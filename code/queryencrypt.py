    # Gpt explains the issue

    # The issue with your decryption code arose because PostgreSQL stores binary data (bytea type) in a hex-encoded format (e.g., \\x674141...).
    # When you queried the database, the encrypted data was returned as a hex string rather than raw bytes.
    # Your decryption function was expecting raw byte data, so when it received a hex-encoded string instead, it couldnâ€™t decrypt it.
    # The solution involved checking if the data was hex-encoded (by looking for the \\x prefix) and converting it back to raw bytes using bytes.fromhex().
    # This way, the decrypted data could be processed correctly, fixing the problem and allowing your code to return the actual decrypted values.
